## Linux

This is the operating system we prefer in this class, as it closely mirrors your auto-grader environment.

1. [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

Setting up a proper development environment in Windows is extremely challenging.
You are more than welcome to try, but we highly recommend booting into Linux directly if you are currently running Windows.

### Windows 10 Pro

1. Booting Linux, like [Ubuntu](https://www.ubuntu.com/)
2. [Coder](https://coder.com/) (Requires: [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/))

### Windows 10 Home

1. Booting Linux, like [Ubuntu](https://www.ubuntu.com/)
