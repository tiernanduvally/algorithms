# Functions on Arrays

---

## Agenda

1. Asymptotic Analysis: Dominant Terms
2. Working with Arrays in C++

---
class: center, middle

## Asymptotic Analysis: Dominant Terms

---

## Some Calculous

We can think of asymptotic analysis as a limit problem:

$$O(kn^2) \rightarrow \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} O(kn^2) = O(n^2)$$

As $n \rightarrow \infty$, we know that $k$ becomes irrelevant.

Hence, when we describe "Big-Oh" notation for a given algorithm, we will always denote just the dominant term.

--

This leads to the important concept of "classes" of algorithms.

Since we do not care about constants, we call all $O(kn)$ functions "linear", and denote them $O(n)$

---

## What is the Big-Oh notation?

### $O(2n)$

### $O(n + n^2)$

### $O(\frac{2^n}{2} + 80n)$

### $O(1,000n + n^3)$

### $O(n * \log{n} + \sqrt{n})$

### $O(n + n + n + n)$

---

## Ordering Algorithms by Speed

Where $c$ is some constant.

| Notation | Name |
|----------|------|
| $O(1)$ | Constant |
| $O(\log{n})$ | Logarithmic |
| $O(\log{n}^c)$ | Polylogarithmic | 
| $O(n)$ | Linear |
| $O(n \cdot \log{n})$ | Linearithmic |
| $O(n^c)$ | Polynomial | 
| $O(c^n)$ | Exponential |

---

## At this point, you should be able to:

- Analyze iterative algorithms and provide their $O(), \Omega(), \Theta()$
- Conceive of and implement algorithms that do not take arrays.
- Sort various algorithms by their asymptotic growth

## Working with Arrays in C++

---

## You Shall Not Pass ... by value

- Arrays in C++ cannot be passed by value
- They can only be passed as pointers (or references)

--

There are a few different ways to pass arrays:

```c++
double sum(int *array, int n) {
    // Things
}

double sum(int array[], int n) {
    // Things
}

// Very uncommon, fixed size array passing.
double sum(int array[10]) {
    // Things
}
```

--

**This class will deal with the first two syntaxes.**

---

## You Shall (Also) Not Return Arrays

- C++ does not allow you to return arrays by value
- Again, you must use a pointer

So, how can we return arrays? Can we use stack allocation?

--

No, we cannot rely on stack allocation, since the memory will be freed when the function returns.

So how can we accomplish this? 

--

We must either directly modify the given array, or allocate a new array on the heap and return its address.

--

**Or**, we can define new classes that handle dynamic allocation for us!

---

## Your turn to implement and analyze some functions!

1. Open VS Code.
2. Commit all of your previous work to an appropriate branch (`git add *` -> `git commit -am "Your message here"`).
3. Checkout the master branch (`git checkout master`).
4. Fetch and merge from upstream (`git fetch upstream && git merge upstream/master`).
5. Create a new branch for today's work (`git checkout -b lab/<topic or number>`).
6. At this point you should have an updated `functions.hpp` file with functions that take arrays.
7. It is your job to create `functions.cpp`, implement and analyze the functions, and pass all of the unit tests.
8. When you want to check your work, compile `functions.cpp` and run. (`g++ source/functions.cpp && ./a.out`)

Be sure to write clean, concise code, remember there are 25 points up for grabs!
